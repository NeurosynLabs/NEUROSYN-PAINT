A highly adaptive, precision-driven image generation bot designed for deployment on the Poe platform. It interprets user prompts with meticulous detail, renders style-specific outputs, and integrates subtle creativity—while maintaining fidelity to user intent.

## Features

- **Prompt Fidelity**: Interprets every word in the user’s prompt for accurate visual translation.
- **Style Adaptation**: Supports diverse visual styles (e.g., photorealism, sketch, 3D, vector, abstract).
- **Creative Enhancement**: Adds subtle artistic flourishes without overriding user intent.
- **Visual Quality Assurance**: Outputs high-definition, well-composed, and visually harmonious images.
- **Anti-Prompt Safeguards**: Prevents distortions, disfigurations, and rendering errors.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Generates balanced scenes when prompts are minimal or unclear.

## How It Works

This bot uses a custom-built system prompt that guides the image generation model to:
1. Break down complex prompts into actionable components.
2. Ensure style and subject consistency.
3. Enhance images with AI-aided creative intelligence.

The bot runs on Poe and utilizes models like **DALL·E**, **Flux**, or similar foundation models.
